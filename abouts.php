			<h1><span>Welcome</span> To Safewest Bloodbank</h1>
			<p>Welcome to Safewest Hospital, located in the heart of Warakapola, where saving lives is our top priority. At our hospital, we have implemented a free blood bank system to ensure that everyone in need has access to safe and healthy blood. We understand the crucial role that blood donations play in saving lives, and that's why we have made it our mission to make the blood donation process easy and accessible for everyone.

				In collaboration with colleges, students, and youth clubs, we organize regular blood donation camps to spread awareness and encourage people to donate blood. We believe that the involvement of the community is essential in creating a sustainable and effective blood donation program, and we are proud to have the support of so many young and enthusiastic individuals.

				At Safewst Hospital, we take every precaution to ensure that our blood bank is of the highest quality. We follow strict screening and testing procedures to ensure that the blood is safe and healthy for transfusion. Our team of trained medical professionals is always available to answer any questions you may have about blood donation and to provide support and guidance throughout the process.

				We understand that the need for blood can arise at any time, and we are committed to providing a reliable and efficient service to meet this need. Our free blood donation service is available to all, regardless of their financial status, and we believe that access to safe and healthy blood should never be a privilege but a fundamental right.

				At Safewst Hospital, we are more than just a hospital â€“ we are a community that cares. Join us in our mission to save lives and make a difference in the world. Donate blood today and help us create a healthier and happier tomorrow for all.</p>
